Objective:
- Identify and remove customers who have exited their bank accounts from the dataset to maintain an accurate and up-to-date customer database.

Business Goals:
- Customer Retention: Identify at-risk customers for targeted interventions.
- Reduce Churn Rate: Implement retention strategies based on data insights.
- Customer Relationship Management: Maintain accurate customer data to improve relationships and personalize services.

Key Metrics:
- Number of Active Customers
- Churn Rate: Percentage of customers who have exited.
- Accuracy of Customer Status Predictions

 Steps Involved:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handle missing values using `dropna()`.
   - Remove duplicates using `drop_duplicates()`.
   - Save the cleaned dataset.

2. Data Analysis:
   - Import necessary libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
   - Load the cleaned dataset.
   - Generate descriptive statistics.
   - Visualize churn distribution and correlations.
   - Export correlation matrix to a CSV.

3. Data Visualization:
   - Use heatmap for correlation analysis.
   - Use boxplot to compare age distribution by churn status.

4. Modeling:
   - Split data into training and test sets.
   - Train a Logistic Regression model.
   - Evaluate the model using classification reports and confusion matrices.
